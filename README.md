# Memory-Mania
 A Memory-Mania is a simple brain-training game that tests a playerâ€™s ability to remember and match pairs of hidden items, such as cards or images. The player flips two cards at a time, trying to find matching pairs. If the cards match, they stay revealed; if not, they are flipped back.
